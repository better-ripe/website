## Introduction

We are working on several initiatives to improve RIPE community engagement, and RIPE NCC activities. We are looking for volunteers, and partners to help us with these initiatives.

## Rules

- All initiatives should be open, and transparent
- Evolution, not revolution
- Open for feedback, and suggestions
- No populism, avoid any topics that might split the community, extinguish any conflicts, and keep the community united

## Initiatives
