## Introduction

Historically it is known that RIPE NCC is an international organization, but provides information only in English. This is a barrier for many people who are not fluent in English. We are looking for ways to improve this situation.

## Status

We are collecting information and topics for discussion.

## Ideas for discussion

- Should RIPE NCC provide information in multiple languages? Is audience of limited English proficiency big enough to justify the costs?
- Prioritizing languages and topics for translation considering budget constraints.
- Crowd-sourcing translations, quality control.
