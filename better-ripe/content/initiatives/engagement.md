## Introduction

Until recently there was understanding in the RIPE NCC that the community engagement is good and that the RIPE NCC is doing a good job in this area. But recent events around the budget have shown that it is not as good as it was thought. Problem got worse by the way how RIPE NCC handled the feedback from the community, and many community members felt that their voices were not heard, and worse in their opinion some of answers was sort of arrogant. Problem got gravely bad when some of RIPE NCC supporters step in and used certain insulting statements about "loud minority", which put final straw on the camel's back and divided the RIPE NCC with the community.
Specifically it is important to highlight that with observation of malicious comments left by "supporters", whole situation looks like malicious misrepresentation of the community to the RIPE NCC management. This is a very dangerous situation, and it is important to address it as soon as possible.
The RIPE NCC has to improve its communication with the community, and it has to be done in a way that will be beneficial for both sides.

## Current state and forecast

On current discussion phase we believe we reached certain understanding that problem exist, and that we need to work on it. Problem is that if traditionally one side downplays the problem, and other side just typically forgets about it, on next disagreement it will be brought up and rift between the RIPE NCC and the community might become damaging. So we need to create a plan, roadmap, and follow it.
Also a lot of community engagement are done over "live" events, such as conferences, meetups, even online meetings (open house etc), while at same time "deffered" engagement that should be done over something like mailing lists, forums, etc, are not done as much as they should be. This is something that should be addressed.

## Examples

### Open house

Open house is a good example of a live event that is done by the RIPE NCC. Technically as any online event it can be viewed as recording and watched later. But there is significant flaws in way how it is done. For example, i will take last CFP Open House at April.

- There was no pre-published slides, so people can prepare questions
- No presentation pre-recorded
- No comprehensive information about the project, so people can review it before the event or even participate in the project (URL, software repositories, etc)

All of these points are important, because it is impossible to ask any question, because nobody had enough time to prepare them. Also it is important to have comprehensive information, website, software repositories, etc, so people can review it before the event or even participate in the project. 

- There was no "after event" communication, so people can ask questions. No forum, mailing list, etc.

## Plan

## Ideas

- Anchors/key people in the RIPE communication channels (mailing lists, forum)
- Opening hot topics for discussion to attract more people
- Strict moderation against toxic and demotivating comments
