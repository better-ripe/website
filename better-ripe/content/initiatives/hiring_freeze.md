## Introduction

Reason of current fee increase is the inflexible operational costs of RIPE NCC that they can't reduce and its Netherlands hiring (FTE) that was increased to too high levels while it was obvious the budget will drop.

It should not happen again and even current situation should be fixed. It might be possible to increase earnings of RIPE NCC without increasing fees by more efficient programs that might be developed by current workforce and will attract new members and sponsors, also if RIPE NCC will create products that will add more direct value for members and sponsors.
