Elections will happen during #RIPE 88 Conference in Krakow this May.

My detailed agenda will be published after RIPE NCC officially accepts my candidacy. It will be aligned with my general activity I've been doing for last 20 years.

My focus points as RIPE NCC Board member will be following:
- Representation of interest of all Members of association (RIPE NCC) from all the countries in RIPE NCC region fairly and equally
- Complete transparency about all RIPE NCC activities communicated via multiple channels in an easy to understand form
