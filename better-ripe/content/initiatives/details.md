## Introduction

We are working on several initiatives to improve RIPE community engagement, and RIPE NCC activities. We are looking for volunteers, and partners to help us with these initiatives.

## Rules

- All initiatives should be open, and transparent
- Evolution, not revolution
- Open for feedback, and suggestions
- No populism, avoid any topics that might split the community, extinguish any conflicts, and keep the community united

## Initiatives

- [Ambassador program](/initiatives/ambassador/)

## Initiatives proposals

This is a list of initiatives that we are considering to start, but we need more feedback, and probably votes from community members, and partners.
