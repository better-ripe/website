## Introduction

At current moment RIPE members pay flat fee equal to all members. This fee is not related to the size of the organization, or the amount of resources used. This fee is used to cover the costs of RIPE NCC operations, and services provided to the community. After recent information about budget increase, many members started to question the fairness of the current fee structure.

## Status

We are collecting information and topics for discussion.

## Ideas for discussion

- Charging members based on the amount of resources used.
- Charging members based on the size of the organization.
- Charging members based on amount of load they are putting on RIPE NCC services and using time of RIPE NCC staff.
- Charging members who are holding and not using resources
- Charging members who broker resources and use them as assets for trade and rental, ensuring fair compensation for the network's operational integrity and sustainability.
- Additional membership packages for those who want to support RIPE NCC extra activities, with or without benefits.
- Legacy resources and membership fees.
- IPv6 only members and membership fees.
