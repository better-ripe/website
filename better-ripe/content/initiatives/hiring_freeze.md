## Introduction

Reason of current fee increase is the inflexible operational costs of RIPE NCC that they can't reduce and its Netherlands hiring (FTE) that was increased to too high levels while it was obvious the budget will drop.
It should not happen again and this should be fixed. If there are hard times, it means we need to be able to adjust salaries/etc, because even if it sounds bad, it is just a choice of RIPE adjustments, or members will be forced to pay more and lay off their own employees.
Fortunately for current situation, we might have better and painless solution: extending RIPE activities with existing workforce to increase sponsorship and value of RIPE NCC membership.
