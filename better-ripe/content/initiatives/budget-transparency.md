## Introduction

At current moment RIPE NCC budget is not transparent enough. If we compare with industry, such as Linux Foundation(US), TDF(Germany), Apache Foundation(US), etc. they have very transparent budgets, and they are publishing them on their websites, but even more available in reports for their members and sponsors. Unfortunately, RIPE NCC reports aren't transparent enough, and it's hard to understand where the money goes, and how it's spent, and what is more worrying it is going worse year by year.
